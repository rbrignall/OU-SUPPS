\instructions{%
You should be able to answer all questions in iCMA~41 after studying 
Units 1, 2 and 3. There are 15 questions in total. Questions 1 to 5 relate 
to Unit 1, Questions 6 to 10 relate to Unit 2 and Questions 11 to 15 relate 
to Unit 3. Before attempting the questions for a particular unit, it may 
help to work through the corresponding practice quiz first.
 
The whole iCMA is marked out of 120. Every question is worth 8 marks. 
You are advised not to use Minitab to answer the questions. You may 
need to use a calculator to answer some questions. 

The completed iCMA should be returned to
\begin{quotation}
M140 Module Team\\
School of Mathematics and Statistics\\
Faculty of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics\\
The Open University\\
Walton Hall\\
Milton Keynes\\
MK7 6AA
\end{quotation}
The completed iCMA \emph{must arrive} by the cut-off date. 

You are advised to obtain proof of posting and to keep a copy of your 
answers for your own records. 

Note that the questions in this document are designed for on screen usage 
via the module website. Some of the instructions within questions may not 
quite suit this printed version, e.g. when the question refers to `box below' 
this should be interpreted as `box in margin'.
